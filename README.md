This is a fun project utilizing: https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews dataset. 

The purpose of this project is to build a **wine recommendation app**. The **user** will go on the app, select bottles of wine they like (cold start problem solution) and reccommend wines that are similar. 

Many of the current web-apps and websites that **recommend** wine aren't necessary recommending on the user's personal taste but rather 'most ranked' 'highest ranked' bottle of wine. 

So what makes this project different is that it's niched to the **user** and the user only! 

Almost like those Netflix Recommendations yet with wine!

## Update 3/1/19
At the moment this is purely experimental and will be utilziing the small dataset presented above. 

We will then build a **collaborative filter** utilizing the **FastAI** library. Learn more here: https://docs.fast.ai/collab.html 

## Future work
If our experiment is successful we will be pulling from other API's to gather much more wine data & build a model on that data. Then we will place this into production and create a simple **web-app**

## Contributing
